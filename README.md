# BackTracking_problems
Core Idea:

Imagine you're solving a maze or puzzle. Backtracking helps you explore all possible paths or arrangements to find a solution.
It works by incrementally building a solution, one step at a time.
If a step leads to a dead end (doesn't meet the problem's constraints), the algorithm backtracks and tries a different option.
Key Features:

Recursion: Backtracking algorithms heavily rely on recursion. A function calls itself with a partially built solution and explores different possibilities.
Depth-first Search: It typically uses a depth-first search approach, meaning it explores one path completely before backtracking and trying another.
Constraints: The algorithm has built-in rules or constraints that guide it towards valid solutions and eliminate invalid ones early on.
